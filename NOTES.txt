NOTES
================================================
SPRING CLOUD CONFIG SERVER
--------------------------
- By default when you change properties file,config server recognises it automatically and picks it immediately.
- You can verify it by accessing : http://localhost:8888/{spring-application-name}/{profile}
- But Client services are not aware of it automatically.
- To make the changes reflected on running Client micro-services, you will have to trigger /actuator/refresh 
  on each microservices individually.

SPRING CLOUD BUS
----------------
- You can use spring cloud bus with message brokers by which you can refresh the 
  properties for all running microservices with just one api hit /actuator/busrefresh
- Run RabbitMQ instance 
  docker run -it --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:4-management
- configure bus in server + all clients
- expose /actuator/busrefresh
- hit the above api for any of the services ( even config server will work ) and it will automatically refreshes for all microservices.

SPRING CLOUD BUS + CONFIG MONITOR
---------------------------------
- You can fully automate the automatic configuration change for all microservices using config monitor.
- Add config monitor in config server.
- It will expose an api /monitor.
- Configure webhook in GitHub => Repository -> Settings -> webhook
- You cant directly use localhost url hence use some online webhook proxies tool like SMEE:
        >> npm install --global smee-client    
        >> smee --url WEBHOOK_PROXY_URL --path /webhook --port <YOUR_PORT>
        >> smee --url https://smee.io/QC4UMQzFsHb8O6qJ --path /monitor --port 8888
